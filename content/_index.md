I'm a full-stack web developer (MERN preferred). I currently serve as the founder at Semrai and co-founder/CTO at Folder. Beyond this, you might find me working on various fun projects with the Sustainability Computing Research Lab and the Helyx Initiative as for volunteer efforts.

If you'd like to work with me, you can find my LinkedIn [**here**](https://linkedin.com/in/josephsemrai). For web applications requiring any systems architecture, my work generally falls under a rate of $70 an hour. For static content, there's a flat rate of $300 per project. **Please contact me to evaluate your project before sending a contract on UpWork.**

Right now, I'm working on:

- **nocap**, a mobile application built with React Native, Express, Firebase, Redux Toolkit, and a bunch of other cool technologies
- [**Folder**](https://app.folder.me), a Dartmouth Tuck supported effort at streamlining online education and advisement
- **Modern Development in 2020**, a comprehensive 700 page book that should turn anyone into a somewhat competent developer

This website will be updated occassionally, and I'll leave technical/experiential posts on here every so often.
