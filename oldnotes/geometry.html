  <h1 class = "return"> Geometry Cram Notes (what I looked at 10 minutes before the test) </h1> <br> <br>
  <h3 class = "links"> <del> I think I did pretty well with these notes, but I don't exactly know my results yet. </del> </h3> <br>
  <h3 class = "links"> I ended up getting one wrong on the Circles, Geometric Measurement and Geometric Properties with Equations part.</h3> <br>
  <h3 class = "links"> This is still a perfect scale score (I think 4 wrong, depending on what you get wrong, is still a perfect scale). </h3> <br>
  <h3 class = "links"> So, these cram notes and Algebra Nation will definitely prepare you for the EOC. </h3> <br>
  <h4 class = "links"> Algebra Nation the night before the test helps. </h4>
