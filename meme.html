<span class="intro"> To actually be fair, you actually have to have a very definitely high IQ to for the most part to understand Rick and Morty for all intents and purposes major way. The humor really is extremely subtle, and without a sort of solid actually grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will kind of go over a typical viewer''s head in a definitely big way. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which for the most part is deftly woven into his characterisation - his for all intents and purposes personal philosophy definitely draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance, which generally shows that the humor really is extremely subtle, and without a generally solid really grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will generally go over a typical viewer's head in a generally big way. The fans kind of understand this stuff; they definitely have the pretty intellectual capacity to truly for all intents and purposes appreciate the depths of these jokes, to actually realize that they're not just funny- they for all intents and purposes say something fairly deep about LIFE in a fairly big way. </a> </span>
