								<h1>look at this to not fail - Unit 1</h1>
								<p>
								(cred to my dude tristan for helping me fill this out)
								</p>
								<p>
								<strong>Space - </strong>The physical gap or interval between two objects
								<br>
								<strong>Place - </strong>A specific point on Earth, distinguished by a particular characteristic.
								<br>
								<strong>Scale - </strong>Generally, the relationship between the portion of Earth being studied and Earth as a whole.
								<br>
								<strong>Cartography - </strong>The science of making maps.
								<br>
								<strong>GPS - </strong>A system that determines the precise position of something on Earth through a series of satellites, tracking stations, and receivers.
								<br>
								<strong>Remote Sensing - </strong>The acquisition of data about Earth’s surface from a satellite orbiting the planet or from other long-distance methods..
								<br>
								<strong>GIS - </strong>Community-based mapping, representing local knowledge and information.
								<br>
								<strong>Geo-tagging - </strong>Identification and storage of a piece of information by its precise latitude and longitude coordinates.
								<br>
								<strong>Situation - </strong>The location of a place relative to another place
								<br>
								<strong>Site - </strong>The physical character of a place
								<br>
								<strong>Formal Region - </strong>An area i* which everyone shares in common one or more distinctive characteristics.
								<br>
								<strong>Environmental Determinism - </strong>A nineteenth- and early twentieth century approach to the study of geography which argued that the general laws sought by human geographers could be found in the physical sciences. Geography was therefore the study of how the physical environment caused human activities.
								<br>
								<strong>Possibilism - </strong>The theory that the physical environment may set limits on human actions, but people have the ability to adjust to the physical environment and choose a course of action from many alternatives.
								<br>
								<strong>Three Pillars of Sustainability - </strong>Economic, environmental, and social 
								<br>
								<strong>Cultural Landscape - </strong>An approach to geography that emphasizes the relationships among social and physical phenomena in a particular study area.
								<br>
								<strong>Land Ordinance of 1785 - </strong>Established a system of purchasing farmland, used grid system, etc.
								<br>
								<strong>Globalization - </strong>Actions or processes that involve the entire world and result in making something worldwide in scope.
								<br><br>
								<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Types of Distortion</span></strong>
								</p><ul>

								<li>The <strong><em>shape</em></strong> of an area can be distorted, so that it appears more elongated or squat than it is in reality.
								<li>The <strong><em>distance</em></strong> between two points may become increased or decreased.
								<li>The <strong><em>relative size</em></strong> of different areas may be altered, so that one area may appear larger than another on a map while it is in reality smaller.
								<li>The <strong><em>direction</em></strong> from one place to another can be distorted.</li></ul>

								<p>
							
									<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Map Projections</span></strong>
								</p>
								<p>
								<strong>Mercator</strong>
								</p><ul>
								
								<li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Shape is distorted very little, direction is consistent, and the map is rectangular. 
								<li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Relative size is grossly distorted toward the poles, making high-latitude places look much larger than they actually are.</li></ul>
								
								<p>
								<strong>Robinson</strong>
								</p><ul>
								
								<li><strong>Advantages: </strong>Useful for displaying information across the oceans.
								<li><strong>Disadvantages: </strong>By allocating space to the oceans, the land areas are much smaller than on interrupted maps of the same size. </li></ul>
								
								<p>
								<strong>Equal Area</strong>
								</p><ul>
								
								<li><strong>Advantages: </strong>the relative sizes of the landmasses on the map are the same as in reality. The projection minimizes distortion in the shapes of most landmasses. Areas toward the North and South poles—such as Greenland and Australia—become more distorted, but they are sparsely inhabited, so distorting their shapes usually is not important.
								<li><strong>Disadvantages: </strong>The Eastern and Western hemispheres are separated into two pieces, a characteristic known as interruption. The meridians (the vertical lines), which in reality converge at the North and South poles, do not converge at all on the map. Also, they do not form right angles with the parallels (the horizontal lines).</li></ul>
								

								
								</li> </ul>
								</li> </ul>
								</li> </ul>

								<p>
								<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Diffusion</span></strong>
								</p><ul>

								<li><strong>Hierarchical - </strong>The spread of a feature or trend from one key person or node of authority or power to other persons or places.
								<li><strong>Relocation - </strong>The spread of a feature or trend through bodily movement of people from one place to another.
								<li><strong>Contagious - </strong>The rapid, widespread diffusion of a feature or trend throughout a population.</li></ul>

								<h2>Question Examples</h2>


								<p>
								<strong>Distance Scale</strong> (question about a map with a distance scale and what to do with the distance scale)
								</p>
								<p>
								<strong>Map Projections </strong>(picture of the three major map projections, get a question about them)
								</p>
								<p>
								<strong>Toponym</strong> (question - 5 choices, which one of these examples is not a toponym: St. Augustine, Jefferson City, Missouri, etc.)
								</p>
								<p>
								<strong>Globalization </strong>(what does globalization do; what does it mean)
								</p>
								<p>
								<strong>Transnational Corporation</strong> (4 descriptions of companies, which one is transnational?)
								</p>
								<p>
								<strong>Time Zones </strong>(map of the timezones and given a situation, what the difference in time would be, i.e. going from east to west)
								</p>
								<p>
								<strong>Land Ordinance of 1785/Early Land Designations</strong> (map and a graphic about how land was parceled out when our country first became a thing, townships, etc.)
								</p>
								<p>
								Maps about female income as a percentage of male income (which statement is most accurate)
								</p>
								<p>
								<strong>Distribution</strong> (distribution of ethnicities map in Los Angeles (which statement is not true, "look at colors")
								</p>
								<p>
								<strong>Renewable Resources</strong> (which of the following pairs of resources and renewability is<strong> incorrect</strong>?) (for example, wind to non-renewable, as wind is renewable)
								</p>
								<p>
								<strong>Impact </strong>(what were the effects of Lake Okeechobee?)
								</p>
								<p>
								<strong>Geography Applied</strong> (why are geographers interested when a hurricane makes landfall (geographers are also interested in the human toll of the hurricane, loss of life, etc.)?
								</p>

										<ul>

										<li>"Doctors" in the past would look at your skull shape to determine your mental health/psychological health</li></ul>

										<p>
										<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Nature/Nurture Argument</span></strong>
										</p><ul>

										<li><strong>Socrates and Plato believed that some ideas are inborn (born with intelligence, etc.)</strong>
										<li><strong>Aristotle and Locke believed that the mind is a blank slate (you are created by your education/environment)</strong> <ul>

										<li>We still have arguments about this today, it is called nature (born that way) or nurture (made that way).</li> </ul>
										</li> </ul>

										<p>
										<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Dualism vs Monism</span></strong>
										</p><ul>

										<li><strong>Socrates - Mind and body were separate</strong>
										<li><strong>Aristotle - Mind and body are one</strong>
										<li><strong>Descartes - Natural instincts in the physical world</strong>, humans (<strong>different)</strong> had a mind to guide the body
										<li><strong>Hobbes - No mind/soul.</strong> Only energy and matter, guided/shaped by brain machinery (conceptually like a computer's logic?)</li></ul>

										<p>
										<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Wundt ("Father of Psychology")</span></strong>
										</p><ul>

										<li><strong>Established the 1st formal laboratory</strong> for psychology research in 1879
										<li>Wanted to identify the parts of the subconscious/unconscious mind
										<li><strong>Started introspection WHICH BECAME STRUCTURALISM - identified the parts that made up the consciousness and the mind</strong>
										<li><strong>Declared psychology a science</strong></li></ul>

										<p>
										<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">William James</span></strong>
										</p><ul>

										<li><strong>Wrote the first textbook, "The Principles of Psychology" </strong>and sold it to big schools, such as Yale, Harvard, etc. 
										<li>American, not particularly happy with Wundt
										<li><strong>FUNCTIONALISM</strong> focused on how consciousness functioned to help people adapt to their environments
										<li>Influenced by Darwin, focused on how thoughts and feelings helped people adapt/survive their environments.</li></ul>

										<p>
										<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Structuralism vs Functionalism</span></strong>
										</p><ul>

										<li>Structuralism <ul>

										<li>Analyzes consciousness into its basic elements  <ul>

										<li><strong>Titchener </strong>continued Wundt's work
										<li>Dependent on introspection, self-observation of one's own conscious experience
										<li>Favored studying using lab experiments
										<li>Functionalism <ul>

										<li>Investigates the function/purpose of consciousness
										<li>Influenced by Darwin's natural selection
										<li><strong>William James</strong>  <ul>

										<li>Charles Darwin's natural selection - characteristics that provide a survival or reproductive advantage are more likely than alternative characteristics to be passed on and be "selected"
										<li>Favored studying via looking at how people adapted to real world situations</li> </ul>
										</li> </ul>
										</li> </ul>
										</li> </ul>
										</li> </ul>

										<p>
										Functionalism thought to have won and spawned the more modern, Applied Psychology and Behaviorism.
										</p>
										<p>
										<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Max Wetheimer (Gestalt Psychology)</span></strong>
										</p><ul>

										<li>Revolted against Wundt
										<li>Believed that consciousness was best understood when observing at the whole experience
										<li>Mix of nature and nurture
										<li>Type of psychology i.e. "look at this picture! If you see the old lady then you are... if you see the young girl then you are…"</li></ul>

										<p>
										<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Calkins</span></strong>
										</p><ul>

										<li>Studied as a guest student at Harvard</li></ul>

										<p>
										<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Washburn</span></strong>
										</p>
										<p>
										<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Leta Stter Hollingworth</span></strong>
										</p>
										<p>
										<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">John B. Watson</span></strong>
										</p><ul>

										<li>Narrow minded, believed that we should only be able to study observable behavior.
										<li>Didn't want to study anything but what we could measure and observe.
										<li><strong>Coined term stimulus</strong>
										<li><strong>Behaviorist, only wanted to study things we could observe ("learning")</strong>
										<li>Believed that he could make anyone into anything. </li></ul>

										<p>
										<strong>Skinner studied underneath Watson</strong>
										</p>
										<p>
										<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">B.F. Skinner</span></strong>
										</p><ul>

										<li><strong>B.F. Skinner = Behaviorism (most important)</strong>
										<li>Organisms tend to repeat responses that lead to positive outcomes, won't repeat responses that lead to neutral/negative responses (he proved this)</li></ul>

										<p>
										<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Sigmund Freud</span></strong>
										</p><ul>

										<li>Big into Free Association, Dream Analysis
										<li><strong>Sigmund Freud = Psychoanalysis to study personality</strong>
										<li>Not observable, believed that dreams were your real feelings
										<li>All behavior and mental processes directed by unconscious forces
										<li>Problems arise from unresolved conflict in the unconscious mind</li></ul>

										<h2>Modern Era</h2>


										<p>
										<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Biological Approach</span></strong>
										</p><ul>

										<li>Study the brain using imaging
										<li>Study the role of drugs on your brain
										<li>Endocrine system - hormones affect you
										<li>We realized that specific drugs can influence how much serotonin, dopamine that your brain takes in to, or by catching neurons to help us with depression, etc</li></ul>

										<p>
										<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Cognitive Approach</span></strong>
										</p><ul>

										<li>BRAIN AND MIND ARE SEPARATE ENTITIES
										<li>BRAIN = PHYSICAL STRUCTURE
										<li>MIND = PERSONALITY, THOUGHTS
										<li>Cognitive Psychology studies the mind
										<li>Cognition = memories, experiences, personality, decision making</li></ul>

										<p>
										<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Evolutionary Perspective</span></strong>
										</p><ul>

										<li>Has evolution played a part in your personality?
										<li>Which human psychological traits are evolved adaptations?
										<li>I.e. was stranger danger a thing 80 years ago? Little kids evolved to avoid strangers based on being told.
										<li>We look for the connections between personality changes and our psychological adaptations to solve problems in human environments</li></ul>

										<p>
										<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Humanism</span></strong>
										</p><ul>

										<li>Anti-Behaviorists 
										<li>Personal enlightenment is achievable, you can overcome anything through personal growth.
										<li>Self actualization - someone who has reached their potential
										<li>Free will and motivation</li></ul>

										<p>
										<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Socio-Cultural</span></strong>
										</p><ul>

										<li>Society matters
										<li>Your behavior depends on how you grew up, who you grew up with
										<li>Behavior can be predicted by the people around you</li></ul>

										<h1>AP Psychology Unit 2 Notes</h1>


										<p>

										<hr>
										</p>
										<h3>Theories</h3>


										<p>
										Explanations using an integrated set of principles that organizes and predicts observations
										</p>
										<h3>Hypothesis</h3>


										<p>
										A testable prediction: often implied in theory
										</p>
										<h3>Laws</h3>


										<p>
										Describes some aspect of the universe, a fact
										</p>
										<h2><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Common Sense</span></h2>

										<ul>

										<li>Conclusions based solely on personal experience and sensible logic
										<li>Can lead to an incorrect conclusion</li></ul>

										<h2><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Research & Observation</span></h2>

										<ul>

										<li><strong>Observation</strong> - the gathering of information by simply watching subjects <ul>

										<li>Can lead to bias as observations may be biased as the observer can change/influence  <ul>

										<li><strong>Bias</strong> - situation in which a factor unfairly increases the likelihood of a researcher reaching a particular conclusion, should be minimized as much as possible in research   <ul>

										<li><strong>Researcher Bias - </strong>the tendency to notice evidence to support one particular point/view or hypothesis, objectivity reduces bias as it relies less on the observers opinion.
										<li><strong>Participant Bias - </strong>tendency of research subjects to respond in certain ways because they know they are being watched. Will behave the way we believe the researcher wants us to behave.</li>   </ul>
										</li>   </ul>
										</li>   </ul>
										</li>   </ul>
										<ul>

										<li><strong>Naturalistic Observation</strong> -<strong> </strong>Method of observation where subjects are observed in their "natural" environment  <ul>

										<li>Subjects are not aware they are being watched (two way mirrors, hidden cameras)</li>  </ul>
										</li>  </ul>

										<h2><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Critical Thinking (Important to follow in this class)</span></h2>

										<ul>

										<li>What am I being asked to believe or accept?
										<li>What evidence is available?
										<li>Are there alternative ways of interpreting the evidence?
										<li>What additional evidence will help evaluate the alternatives?
										<li>What conclusion are most reasonable?</li></ul>

										<h2><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Case Studies</span></h2>

										<ul>

										<li>In depth study of one individual with the hopes of determining universal principles of behavior <ul>

										<li><strong>VERY OPEN TO BIAS</strong>
										<li>Difficulty of applying data from one person to everyone (data unrepresentative of everyone)
										<li><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Why do we need case studies?</span> <ul>

										<li>Sometimes a case study is all that is ethically possible (i.e. survivors of concentration camps, child abuse, madden tournament shooting, etc. <strong>We can't recreate these</strong>)
										<li><strong>Limitations of case studies</strong> <ul>

										<li>They are useless in providing evidence to test behavioral theories or treatments
										<li>Most case studies rely on the observations of a single investigator</li> </ul>
										</li> </ul>
										</li> </ul>
										</li> </ul>

										<h2><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Correlation</span></h2>

										<ul>

										<li><strong>Correlation != Causation (duh doy, common sense)</strong>
										<li>Know the extent to which two variables are related <ul>

										<li><strong>Correlational Study </strong>- research study designed to determine the degree to which two variables are related to another  <ul>

										<li>Do not determine why the two variables are related- just that they are related
										<li><strong>DO NOT IMPLY A CAUSE AND EFFECT RELATIONSHIP</strong>
										<li>Are helpful to making predictions
										<li><strong>Scatterplots - </strong>How we figure out correlation, graph determines type of correlation</li></ul>
										</li></ul>
										</li></ul>
										<ul>

										<li><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Positive correlation</span> - (rises together and falls together, i.e. x goes up, y goes up; x goes down, y goes down)
										<li><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Negative correlation</span> - (inverse, i.e. x goes up, y goes down; y goes up, x goes down)
										<li><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Zero correlation</span> - (no relationship between variables, "scattered")</li> </ul>

										<h2><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Survey Method</span></h2>

										<ul>

										<li>Research method that relies and self-reports: uses surveys, questionnaires, interviews. <ul>

										<li>Usually very efficient and inexpensive
										<li><strong>Population </strong>- the large group from which your sample comes from
										<li><strong>Random Sample </strong>- sample that represents a population, every member of the population has an <span style="text-decoration:underline;">equal chance of being included</span> in the survey
										<li><strong>Representative Sample </strong>- When a group is chosen randomly, it is representative of the population (same thing-ish as random sample)
										<li>You do not have to survey the entire population</li> </ul>
										</li> </ul>

										<h2><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Longitudinal Study</span></h2>

										<ul>

										<li>Developmental study where researchers study the same group of individuals for many years <ul>

										<li><strong>Takes a very long time</strong>
										<li>Provides a rich source of data as time passes, but can be very expensive and difficult to conduct</li> </ul>
										</li> </ul>

										<h2><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Cross-Sectional Study</span></h2>

										<ul>

										<li>Developmental study where researchers simultaneously study a number of subjects from different age groups and then compare the results. <ul>

										<li>More efficient, cheaper, easier than longitudinal studies.
										<li><strong>Group differences may be due to factors other than development.</strong></li> </ul>
										</li> </ul>

										<h2><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Experiments</span></h2>

										<ul>

										<li><strong>ONLY WAY TO DETERMINE CAUSATION (cause and effect)</strong>
										<li>The experiment is the only method that allows us to draw conclusions about cause and effect relations.
										<li>AP Test MC Example: How can we draw conclusions through cause and effect? Answer: Experimentation <ul>

										<li><strong>Theory - </strong>explanation that integrates principles and organizes and predicts behavior or events
										<li><strong>Hypothesis -</strong> testable prediction, often prompted by a theory, to enable us to accept, reject, or revise the theory
										<li><strong>OPERATIONAL DEFINITIONS - </strong>A specification of the exact procedures used to make a variable specific and measurable for research purposes  <ul>

										<li>Vital to the recreation of the experiment
										<li>You must agree with someone's definition of something when evaluating others' research
										<li><strong>Independent Variables </strong>- Causes something to happen or change.  <ul>

										<li>What causes the behavior to happen.
										<li><strong>Dependent Variables</strong> - The thing that was changed, the variable being measured.  <ul>

										<li>Behavior that the researchers are looking for.
										<li><strong>Experimental Group - </strong>The subjects who are exposed to the treatment.
										<li><strong>Control Group - </strong>The subjects who are <strong>not </strong>exposed to the independent variable.
										<li><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Blind Procedure</span></strong> - The research participants are ignorant to the expected outcome of the experiment (placebo drugs, etc.)  <ul>

										<li>Those collecting data can be influenced by their own expectations, potential issue with bias.
										<li><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Double Blind Procedure</span></strong> - both the research participants and those collecting the data are ignorant to the expected outcome of the experiment</li> </ul>
										</li> </ul>
										</li> </ul>
										</li> </ul>
										</li> </ul>
										</li> </ul>

										<h2><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Ethics</span></h2>

										<ul>

										<li><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Informed Consent </span>- </strong>Participants must be informed about the general nature of the research, <strong>any potential risk</strong> <ul>

										<li>Participants must have the right to refuse participation or withdraw at any time
										<li><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Right to be Protected from Harm and Discomfort</span></strong> <ul>

										<li>Studies involving harm or discomfort still can happen with <span style="text-decoration:underline;">informed consent</span>
										<li><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Right of Confidentiality</span></strong> - Individual data about research participants should never be released or discussed
										<li><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Right to Debriefing</span></strong> <ul>

										<li>Tell the participants a complete explanation of the research at the end of the study.
										<li><strong>Extremely important if the research involves deception</strong></li> </ul>
										</li> </ul>
										</li> </ul>
										</li> </ul>

									<h2>The Human Brain</h2>

									<ul>

									<li>100 billion neurons in your body, most of them are near the brain which weighs about 3 pounds
									<li>It is responsible for all thinking, keeping you alive, etc.
									<li>It is the most complex system in the world
									<li>Even if you lose over 200,000 cells per day in your adult life, you'll still end up with over 98% of your brain cells
									<li><strong>Brain cells do regenerate</strong></li></ul>

									<h2>How Your Body Communicates</h2>


									<p>
									The body has two communication systems.
									</p><ul>

									<li>The <strong>nervous system</strong> (works quickly) <ul>

									<li>Neurons  <ul>

									<li>Electrically charged
									<li><strong>Dendrites</strong> - Receive information
									<li><strong>Axon Terminals</strong> - Carries a message down the cord (like the copper inside the rubber insulation)
									<li><strong>Myelin Sheath</strong> - insulating fatty layer that speeds transmission and protects the axon (like the rubber insulation on a lightning cable)
									<li><strong>There is a gap between neurons called <span style="text-decoration:underline;">the synaptic gap.</span></strong>
									<li><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">3 types of neurons</span></strong>   <ul>

									<li><strong>Sensory Neurons</strong>    <ul>

										<li>All of our senses
										<li>Flow up to the brain
									<li><strong>Motor Neurons</strong>    <ul>

										<li>Only flow down from the brain
										<li>Run all muscles, organs, and glands.
									<li><strong>Interneurons</strong>    <ul>

										<li>More interneurons than motor or sensory neurons
										<li>Connect sensory neurons to motor neurons
									<li>Neurons don't actually touch each other. They send information over the <strong>synapse, synaptic space, </strong>or <strong>synaptic cleft.</strong>   <ul>

									<li>The synapse acts like an electrical insulator, preventing an electric charge from racing to the next cell.
									<li>Composed of terminal buttons.
									<li><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Reuptake</span> - </strong>Neurotransmitters that are not absorbed by the connecting dendrite are reabsorbed by the sending neuron in a process called reuptake.</li>  </ul>
									</li>  </ul>
									</li>  </ul>
									</li>  </ul>
									</li>  </ul>
									</li>  </ul>

									<ul>

									<li>Feel good chemical
									<li>Endorphins are not neurotransmitter molecules
									<li>Released during exercises, in injury, etc.
									<li>Classified as neuromodulatory</li></ul>

									<h2>Neural Communications</h2>

									<ul>

									<li><strong>Agonists (excite) - </strong>make neuron fire <ul>

									<li>Amplify or mimick sensation
									<li>Agonist-opiates mimic the high produced naturally
									<li><strong>Antagonists (inhibit) - </strong>stop neural firing <ul>

									<li>Blocking the absorption of our neurotransmitters
									<li>Antagonist-botulin blocks ACh</li> </ul>
									</li> </ul>
									</li> </ul>

									<p>
									<strong>Psychopharmacology </strong>- most psychoactive drugs work by blocking/enhancing synaptic transmission.
									</p>
									<p>
									<strong>Botulism</strong> <strong>- </strong>blocks release of ACh at the neuromuscular junction, causing paralysis.
									</p>
									<p>
									<strong>Curare - </strong>can stun or kill prey quickly, blocks ACh receptors
									</p><ul>

									<li><strong>Antipsychotic medications</strong> <ul>

									<li>Block dopamine receptors
									<li>Reduces schizophrenic hallucination</li> </ul>
									</li> </ul>

									<p>
									<strong>Caffeine - increases the release of excitatory…</strong>
									</p>
									<p>
									<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Neural Plasticity</span></strong> <strong>- </strong>the ability of our brains to form new connections after neurons are damaged. The brain can be changed both structurally and chemically by experience.
									</p>
									<p>
									<strong>The central nervous system consists of the brain and the spinal cord.</strong>
									</p>
									<p>
									<strong>Everything else is the peripheral nervous system.</strong>
									</p>
									<h2>Central Nervous System</h2>

									<ul>

									<li><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Contains the brain and spinal cord</span> <ul>

									<li>The Spinal Cord  <ul>

									<li>Complex cable of nerves that connects the brain to the rest of the body.</li>  </ul>
									</li>  </ul>
									</li>  </ul>

									<h2>Peripheral Nervous System		</h2>

									<ul>

									<li>All nerves that are not encased in bone
									<li>Everything but the brain and spinal cord.
									<li>Divided into two categories <strong>somatic </strong>and <strong>automatic.</strong> <ul>

									<li><strong>Somatic -</strong> controls voluntary muscle movement, uses motor (efferent) neurons.
									<li><strong>Autonomic - </strong>controls the automatic functions of the body.
									<li>Divided into two categories… the <strong>sympathetic </strong>and the <strong>parasympathetic.</strong>  <ul>

									<li><strong>Sympathetic - </strong> fight or flight responses, automatically accelerates heart rate, breathing, dilates pupils, slows down digestion, etc.
									<li><strong>Parasympathetic - </strong>automatically slows the body down after a stressful event. Heart rate and breathing slow down, pupils constrict and digestion speeds up.
									<li><strong>Reflexes</strong> <ul>

									<li>Normally, sensory (afferent) neurons take info up through the spine to the brain.
									<li>Some reactions occur when sensory neurons reach just the spinal cord
									<li><strong>It is a survival adaptation </strong></li> </ul>

											</p>
											<h3>Hindbrain</h3>
											
											<ul>
											
											<li>Structures on top of our spinal cord
											<li>Controls our basic biological structures</li></ul>
											
											<h3>Cerebral Cortex-</h3>
											
											<ul>
											
											<li>Top layer of our brain

											</li> </ul>
											
											<h3>Frontal Lobe</h3>
											
											<ul>
											
											<li>Abstract thought and emotional control
											<li>Contains <strong>Motor Cortex</strong>: sends signals to our body controlling muscle movement 
											<li>Contains <strong>Broca's Area:</strong> responsible for controlling muscles that produce speech

								<h2>Prenatal Development</h2>
									<h3>Conception</h3>

									<ul>

									<li><strong>Drop of an egg and the release of about 200 million sperm</strong>
									<li><strong>Sperm seeks out the egg and attempts to penetrate its surface.</strong></li></ul>

									<h3>Zygote</h3>

									<ol>

									<li><strong>Zygote, the first stage of prenatal development. It lasts for about two weeks and consists of rapid cell division.</strong>
									<li><strong>Less than half of all zygotes survive the first two weeks. About 10 days after conception, the zygote will attach itself to the uterine wall.</strong>
									<li><strong>Outer part of the zygote becomes the placenta (which filters nutrients)</strong></li></ol>

									<p>
									<strong>After two weeks, the zygote develops into an embryo…</strong>
									</p>
									<h3>Embryo</h3>

									<ul>

									<li>Lasts about 6 weeks
									<li>Heart begins to beat and the organs begin to develop</li></ul>

									<p>
									Nine weeks in, the embryo develops into a fetus
									</p>
									<h3>Fetus</h3>

									<ul>

									<li>By the 6th month, the stomach and other organs have formed enough to survive outside the mother.
									<li>At this time, the baby and hear and recognize sounds and respond to light.</li></ul>

									<h3>Teratogens</h3>

									<ul>

									<li>Chemicals or viruses that can enter the placenta and harm the developing fetus. <ul>

									<li>Ex. If a mother is a heroin addict, her baby will also be a heroin addict.
									<li>Ez. If a mother has AIDS, her baby may also
									<li><strong>Fetal Alcohol Syndrome</strong> - Even one drop of alcohol can cause developmental problems.</li></ul>
									</li></ul>

									<h3>APGAR Test</h3>

									<ul>

									<li>Quick physical test given to every newborn at birth</li></ul>

									<p>
									A - Activity or muscle
									</p>
									<p>
									P - Pulse, ideally over 100bpm
									</p>
									<p>
									G - Grimace, reflex irritability (sneeze or cough)
									</p>
									<p>
									A - Appearance (normal skin color)
									</p>
									<p>
									R - Respiration (breathing)
									</p>
									<p>
									Scores are given (1-5). If you fail, they test you again 10 minutes later.
									</p>
									<h3>Characteristics of Healthy Newborns</h3>

									<ul>

									<li>Turn heads toward voices
									<li>See 8-12 inches from their face
									<li>Gaze longer at objects that look like humans
									<li>Recognize mom's voice first</li></ul>

									<h3>Reflexes</h3>

									<ul>

									<li>Inborn automatic responses
									<li>Rooting (cheek)
									<li>Sucking
									<li>Grasping
									<li>Moro (startle)
									<li>Babinski</li></ul>

									<h3>How do brain and motor skills develop?</h3>

									<ul>

									<li><strong>Good News</strong> <ul>

									<li>You produce almost ¼ million brain cells per minute
									<li><strong>Bad News</strong> <ul>

									<li>Basically all the brain cells you are ever going to develop.</li> </ul>
									</li> </ul>
									</li> </ul>

									<h3>The Brain and Infancy</h3>

									<ul>

									<li>Although the brain does not develop many new cells, the existing cells begin to work more efficiently-forming more complex neural networks</li></ul>

									<h3>Infant Memory</h3>

									<ul>

									<li>The earliest age of conscious memory is around 3.5 years
									<li>Often called infantile amnesia
									<li>A 5-year-old has a sense of self and an increased long-term memory, thus organization of memory is different from 3-4 years.</li></ul>

									<h3>Maturation</h3>

									<ul>

									<li>The biological growth processes that enable orderly changes in behavior, relatively uninfluenced by experience.
									<li>We all maturate similarly to a certain extent, but the time can vary depending on the person.</li></ul>

									<h3>Motor Development</h3>


									<p>
									Sequence is the same but once again timing varies
									</p>
									<p>
									First learn to roll over, sit up unsupported, crawl, walk, etc.
									</p>
									<h3>Walking</h3>


									<p>
									In the United States:
									</p>
									<p>
									25% learn by 11 months
									</p>
									<p>
									50% within a week of their 1st birthday
									</p>
									<p>
									90% by 15 months
									</p><ul>

									<li>Walking varies by culture - if the culture emphasizes walking, then babies can walk at younger ages (NURTURE)
									<li>Identical twins tend to learn to walk on the same day.</li></ul>

									<h3>Toilet Training</h3>

									<ul>

									<li>No matter what, the baby needs the physical maturation to hold his or her bladder r bowel movements before toilet training.
									<li>No training will work if the child is not physically ready.</li></ul>

									<p>
									<strong>2 months - turns head to follow moving object</strong>
									</p>
									<p>
									<strong>9 months - sits alone for one minute, says dada</strong>
									</p>
									<p>
									<strong>1 year - walks while holding on to something</strong>
									</p>
									<p>
									<strong>1 year 3 months - walks alone says several words</strong>
									</p>
									<p>
									<strong>1 year 6 months - climbs stairs, says many words</strong>
									</p>
									<p>
									<strong>2 years - runs, uses simple word combinations</strong>
									</p>
									<p>
									<strong>3 years - puts on shoes</strong>
									</p>
									<p>
									<strong>4 years - laces shoes</strong>
									</p>
									<p>
									<strong>5 years - names penny, nickel, and dime</strong>
									</p>
									<p>
									<strong>6 years - describes differences between bird and dog</strong>
									</p>
									<p>
									<strong>7 years - tells time to quarter hour</strong>
									</p>
									<p>
									<strong>8 years - tells how baseball and orange or an airplane and a kite are alike.</strong>
									</p>
									<h3>Cognitive Development</h3>


									<p>
									Field dominated by a man named Jean Piaget.
									</p><ul>

									<li>Developed IQ tests and noticed that many children got the same answers wrong.
									<li>Thought to himself, "maybe these kids are not stupid, but instead think differently than adults"</li></ul>

									<h3>Jean Piaget's Concepts</h3>

									<ul>

									<li>Children are active thinkers, always trying to make sense of the world <ul>

									<li>To make sense of the world, children develop schemas  <ul>

									<li>Schema - Concept or framework that organizes and interprets information.
									<li>Assimilation - Interpreting one's new experiences into one's existing schemas.
									<li>Accommodation - Adapting one's current understandings (schemas) to incorporate new information.</li>  </ul>
									</li>  </ul>
									</li>  </ul>

									<h3>Piaget's Stages of Cognitive Development</h3>

									<ul>

									<li>Sensorimotor <ul>

									<li>From birth to 2 years of age.
									<li>Take in the world purely through their senses- looking, hearing, touching, tasting, and grasping.  <ul>

									<li>At 4-8 months of age, children will learn that they can make things move by banging them and shaking them.
									<li>Between 12 and 18 months, children will be able to represent hidden objects in their minds (object permanence) (they know that objects don't disappear and will be able to "see" objects even when they are out of sight"   <ul>

									<li>Before this, objects out of sight is gone from the universe forever.l
									<li>21 months old, 24 months old - scale problems (brain doesn't process scale properly, for example, you'll try to get in a toy car that's 4 inches big that looks the same as your miniature toy car that you can actually get in.
									<li>Preoperational <ul>

									<li>From 2-7 years old.  <ul>

									<li>Develop the ability to use symbols (happy face, mickey mouse, etc.)
									<li>By the end of this stage, the child will understand the concept of conservation.
									<li><strong>Egocentric</strong> - inability to take on another's point of view.
									<li>Concrete Operational <ul>

									<li>7-11 years  <ul>

									<li>Understand concept of conservation.
									<li>Can think logically, use analogies, and perform mathematical transformations (5+9 is the same as 9+5) also known as reversibility.
									<li>Lacks abstract thinking ability
									<li>Formal Operational <ul>

									<li>11- BLANK years
									<li>Reason abstractly
									<li>Reasoning expands from concrete (involving actual experiences) to abstract thinking (involving imagined realities and symbols)
									<li>Children are able to solve hypothetical situations and its consequences.</li> </ul>
									</li> </ul>
									</li> </ul>
									</li> </ul>
									</li> </ul>
									</li> </ul>
									</li> </ul>
									</li> </ul>
									</li> </ul>

									<h3>Social Development</h3>

									<ul>

									<li>Up until about a year, infants do not mind strange people (maybe because everyone is strange to them)
									<li>After about a year, they develop stranger anxiety <ul>

									<li>Infants form schemas for familiar faces and cannot assimilate a new face at about 8 months (this age)
									<li>All about identity forming <ul>

									<li>Identity: One's sense of self (how you see yourself)
									<li><strong>Erik Erikson (stages of social development dude)</strong> - The idea that an adolescent's job is to find oneself by testing various roles.  <ul>

									<li>Some teenages take their identify early by sharing their parents values and expectations
									<li>Negative identity - opposition to society, adopt and conform to a peer group.
									<li><strong>Towards the end of adolescence</strong>, intimacy becomes the prime goal.</li> </ul>
									</li> </ul>
									</li> </ul>
									</li> </ul>

									<h3>Stages</h3>


									<p>
									<strong>Birth - 18 months</strong>
									</p><ul>

									<li><strong>Feeding </strong>
									<li>Infants form a loving, trusting relationship with parents
									<li>They may learn to mistrust others (comfort from parents leading to trust) (parents just feeding and not providing comfort are mistrusted in a sense)</li></ul>

									<p>
									<strong>18 months - 3 years</strong>
									</p><ul>

									<li><strong>Toilet training</strong>
									<li>Child's energy is directed toward physical skills: walking, grasping, and toilet training. The child learns control along with a healthy dose of shame and doubt.</li></ul>

									<p>
									<strong>3-5 years</strong>
									</p><ul>

									<li><strong>Independence</strong>
									<li>Child becomes more assertive, takes more initiative, and becomes more forceful.</li></ul>

									<p>
									<strong>6-12 years</strong>
									</p><ul>

									<li><strong>School</strong>
									<li>The child must deal with demands to learn new skills while risking a sense of inferiority and failure.</li></ul>

									<p>
									<strong>Adolescence</strong>
									</p><ul>

									<li><strong>Peers</strong>
									<li>Teens must achieve self-identity while deciphering their roles in occupation, politics, and religion.</li></ul>

									<p>
									<strong>Young Adult (early 20s to early 40s)</strong>
									</p><ul>

									<li><strong>Relationships</strong>
									<li>The young adult must develop marriage-seeking relationships while combating feelings of isolation.</li></ul>

									<p>
									<strong>Middle Adult (40s-60s)</strong>
									</p><ul>

									<li><strong>Parenting</strong>
									<li><strong>Generativity vs. Stagnation</strong>
									<li>Assuming the role of parents signifies the need to continue the generations while avoiding the inevitable feeling of failure.</li></ul>

									<p>
									<strong>Late Adult (late 60s and up)</strong>
									</p><ul>

									<li><strong>Life reflection</strong>
									<li><strong>Integrity vs. Despair</strong>
									<li>Acceptance of one's lifetime accomplishments and sense of fulfillment.</li></ul>

									<h3>Origins of Attachment</h3>

									<ul>

									<li>Harry Harlow <ul>

									<li>Showed that monkeys needed touch or body contact to form an attachment.
									<li>The most important social construct an infant must develop is <strong>attachment.</strong>  <ul>

									<li>For many animals, there is a critical period shortly after birth when an organism's exposure to certain stimuli or experience produce proper development.
									<li>Those who are deprived of touch have trouble forming attachment when they are older
									<li>Mary Ainsworth <ul>

									<li>Strange Situation Test  <ul>

									<li>Three types of attachment   <ul>

									<li>Secure    <ul>

										<li>When Mom comes back, you are comforted and function normally
									<li>Avoidant    <ul>

										<li>You don't allow Mom to comfort you.
									<li>Anxious/ambivalent    <ul>

										<li>You don't settle down when mom is comforting you.
									<li>Iana Baumrind's Child Rearing Practices <ul>

									<li><strong>Authoritarian</strong>: Parents impose rules and expect obedience, "Don't interrupt", "Clean your room".
									<li><strong>Permissive</strong>: Parents submit to children's demands and use little punishment.
									<li><strong>Authoritative</strong>: Parents are demanding but responsive to their children. They exert control not only by setting rules and enforcing them but also by explaining the reasons and exceptions when making the rules.</li> </ul>
									</li> </ul>
									</li> </ul>
									</li> </ul>
									</li> </ul>
									</li> </ul>
									</li> </ul>
									</li> </ul>
									</li> </ul>
									</li> </ul>

									<h3>Frontal Lobe development and impulse control</h3>

									<ul>

									<li>Myelin growth accelerates
									<li>Fluid intelligence - hand eye coordination (younger people have higher fluid intelligence)
									<li>Older people have "crystallized" intelligence
									<li>Frontal lobe maturation lags the emotional limbic system
									<li>More likely to end up ina fight when in this stage
									<li>By 25, improved judgement, impulse control, and the ability to plan for the long term. <ul>

									<li>Before the age of 25, the Supreme Court has decided to give reduced sentences</li> </ul>
									</li> </ul>

									<h3>Lawrence Kohlberg and his stages of Morality</h3>

									<ul>

									<li>Preconventional Morality <ul>

									<li>First stage, morality of self-interest
									<li>Their actions are either to avoid punishment or to gain rewards
									<li>Lasts until 9 years old
									<li>Conventional Morality <ul>

									<li>9 and up
									<li>Morality is based on obeying laws
									<li>We like to have social order and gain social approval
									<li>Postconventional Morality <ul>

									<li>17-Adulthood (late adolescence)
									<li>Morality based on your own ethical principles
									<li>To affirm agreed-upon rights and personal ethical principles</li> </ul>
									</li> </ul>
									</li> </ul>
									</li> </ul>

									<p>
									As you progress up the "ladder of mortality", it becomes less about you and egocentrism.
									</p>
									<p>
									<strong>	Criticisms of Lawrence Kohlberg's Theory of Moral Development</strong>
									</p><ul>

									<li>Great deal of overlap
									<li>Gender bias (girls are taught empathy, while boys are taught justice)
									<li>Cognitive abilities influence moral development <ul>

									<li>See other people's point of view
									<li>Understanding vs. action (isn't really talked about in this theory)</li></ul>
									</li></ul>

									<h3>Adulthood</h3>


									<p>
									<strong>Physical Milestones</strong>
									</p><ul>

									<li>Menopause: the natural ending of a woman's ability to reproduce <ul>

									<li>Physical symptoms led by a lack of estrogen
									<li>Men don't experience anything like menopause
									<li>Sensory ability declines when you get older
									<li>The brain processes information at slower speeds at these old ages</li></ul>
									</li></ul>

									<h3>Types of Intelligence</h3>


									<p>
									<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Crystallized Intelligence</span></strong>
									</p><ul>

									<li>Accumulated knowledge
									<li>Increases with age</li></ul>
									<ul>

									<li><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Fluid Intelligence</span></strong>
									<li>Ability to solve problems quickly and think abstractly
									<li>Peaks in the 20's and then decreases over time</li></ul>

									<h3>Cognitive Changes</h3>

									<ul>

									<li>We tend to remember events from or teens and twenties
									<li>Difference between recognition and recall. Recognition remains stable… (didn't get it down)</li></ul>

									<p>
									<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Alzheimer's Disease</span></strong>
									</p><ul>

									<li>A progressive and irreversible brain disorder characterized by gradual deterioration of memory, language, and physical functioning
									<li>Runs its course in 5 to 20 years.
									<li>Caused by the deterioration of neurons that produce the neurotransmitter: ACH (Acetylcholine)</li></ul>

									<h3>Life Expectancy</h3>

									<ul>

									<li>Life expectancy keeps increasing - now about 75
									<li>Women outlive men by about 4 years</li></ul>

									<h3>Stages of Death/Grief</h3>

									<ul>

									<li>Elizabeth Kubler-Ross's Stages of Death/Grief: <ul>

									<li>1. Denial
									<li>2. Anger
									<li>3. Bargaining
									<li>4. Depression
									<li>5. Acceptance
									<li>Doesn't necessarily have to be in this order.
