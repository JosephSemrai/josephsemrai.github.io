										<ul>

										<li>"Doctors" in the past would look at your skull shape to determine your mental health/psychological health</li></ul>

										<p>
										<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Nature/Nurture Argument</span></strong>
										</p><ul>

										<li><strong>Socrates and Plato believed that some ideas are inborn (born with intelligence, etc.)</strong>
										<li><strong>Aristotle and Locke believed that the mind is a blank slate (you are created by your education/environment)</strong> <ul>

										<li>We still have arguments about this today, it is called nature (born that way) or nurture (made that way).</li> </ul>
										</li> </ul>

										<p>
										<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Dualism vs Monism</span></strong>
										</p><ul>

										<li><strong>Socrates - Mind and body were separate</strong>
										<li><strong>Aristotle - Mind and body are one</strong>
										<li><strong>Descartes - Natural instincts in the physical world</strong>, humans (<strong>different)</strong> had a mind to guide the body
										<li><strong>Hobbes - No mind/soul.</strong> Only energy and matter, guided/shaped by brain machinery (conceptually like a computer's logic?)</li></ul>

										<p>
										<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Wundt ("Father of Psychology")</span></strong>
										</p><ul>

										<li><strong>Established the 1st formal laboratory</strong> for psychology research in 1879
										<li>Wanted to identify the parts of the subconscious/unconscious mind
										<li><strong>Started introspection WHICH BECAME STRUCTURALISM - identified the parts that made up the consciousness and the mind</strong>
										<li><strong>Declared psychology a science</strong></li></ul>

										<p>
										<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">William James</span></strong>
										</p><ul>

										<li><strong>Wrote the first textbook, "The Principles of Psychology" </strong>and sold it to big schools, such as Yale, Harvard, etc. 
										<li>American, not particularly happy with Wundt
										<li><strong>FUNCTIONALISM</strong> focused on how consciousness functioned to help people adapt to their environments
										<li>Influenced by Darwin, focused on how thoughts and feelings helped people adapt/survive their environments.</li></ul>

										<p>
										<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Structuralism vs Functionalism</span></strong>
										</p><ul>

										<li>Structuralism <ul>

										<li>Analyzes consciousness into its basic elements  <ul>

										<li><strong>Titchener </strong>continued Wundt's work
										<li>Dependent on introspection, self-observation of one's own conscious experience
										<li>Favored studying using lab experiments
										<li>Functionalism <ul>

										<li>Investigates the function/purpose of consciousness
										<li>Influenced by Darwin's natural selection
										<li><strong>William James</strong>  <ul>

										<li>Charles Darwin's natural selection - characteristics that provide a survival or reproductive advantage are more likely than alternative characteristics to be passed on and be "selected"
										<li>Favored studying via looking at how people adapted to real world situations</li> </ul>
										</li> </ul>
										</li> </ul>
										</li> </ul>
										</li> </ul>

										<p>
										Functionalism thought to have won and spawned the more modern, Applied Psychology and Behaviorism.
										</p>
										<p>
										<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Max Wetheimer (Gestalt Psychology)</span></strong>
										</p><ul>

										<li>Revolted against Wundt
										<li>Believed that consciousness was best understood when observing at the whole experience
										<li>Mix of nature and nurture
										<li>Type of psychology i.e. "look at this picture! If you see the old lady then you are... if you see the young girl then you are…"</li></ul>

										<p>
										<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Calkins</span></strong>
										</p><ul>

										<li>Studied as a guest student at Harvard</li></ul>

										<p>
										<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Washburn</span></strong>
										</p>
										<p>
										<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Leta Stter Hollingworth</span></strong>
										</p>
										<p>
										<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">John B. Watson</span></strong>
										</p><ul>

										<li>Narrow minded, believed that we should only be able to study observable behavior.
										<li>Didn't want to study anything but what we could measure and observe.
										<li><strong>Coined term stimulus</strong>
										<li><strong>Behaviorist, only wanted to study things we could observe ("learning")</strong>
										<li>Believed that he could make anyone into anything. </li></ul>

										<p>
										<strong>Skinner studied underneath Watson</strong>
										</p>
										<p>
										<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">B.F. Skinner</span></strong>
										</p><ul>

										<li><strong>B.F. Skinner = Behaviorism (most important)</strong>
										<li>Organisms tend to repeat responses that lead to positive outcomes, won't repeat responses that lead to neutral/negative responses (he proved this)</li></ul>

										<p>
										<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Sigmund Freud</span></strong>
										</p><ul>

										<li>Big into Free Association, Dream Analysis
										<li><strong>Sigmund Freud = Psychoanalysis to study personality</strong>
										<li>Not observable, believed that dreams were your real feelings
										<li>All behavior and mental processes directed by unconscious forces
										<li>Problems arise from unresolved conflict in the unconscious mind</li></ul>

										<h2>Modern Era</h2>


										<p>
										<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Biological Approach</span></strong>
										</p><ul>

										<li>Study the brain using imaging
										<li>Study the role of drugs on your brain
										<li>Endocrine system - hormones affect you
										<li>We realized that specific drugs can influence how much serotonin, dopamine that your brain takes in to, or by catching neurons to help us with depression, etc</li></ul>

										<p>
										<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Cognitive Approach</span></strong>
										</p><ul>

										<li>BRAIN AND MIND ARE SEPARATE ENTITIES
										<li>BRAIN = PHYSICAL STRUCTURE
										<li>MIND = PERSONALITY, THOUGHTS
										<li>Cognitive Psychology studies the mind
										<li>Cognition = memories, experiences, personality, decision making</li></ul>

										<p>
										<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Evolutionary Perspective</span></strong>
										</p><ul>

										<li>Has evolution played a part in your personality?
										<li>Which human psychological traits are evolved adaptations?
										<li>I.e. was stranger danger a thing 80 years ago? Little kids evolved to avoid strangers based on being told.
										<li>We look for the connections between personality changes and our psychological adaptations to solve problems in human environments</li></ul>

										<p>
										<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Humanism</span></strong>
										</p><ul>

										<li>Anti-Behaviorists 
										<li>Personal enlightenment is achievable, you can overcome anything through personal growth.
										<li>Self actualization - someone who has reached their potential
										<li>Free will and motivation</li></ul>

										<p>
										<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Socio-Cultural</span></strong>
										</p><ul>

										<li>Society matters
										<li>Your behavior depends on how you grew up, who you grew up with
										<li>Behavior can be predicted by the people around you</li></ul>

										<h1>AP Psychology Unit 2 Notes</h1>


										<p>

										<hr>
										</p>
										<h3>Theories</h3>


										<p>
										Explanations using an integrated set of principles that organizes and predicts observations
										</p>
										<h3>Hypothesis</h3>


										<p>
										A testable prediction: often implied in theory
										</p>
										<h3>Laws</h3>


										<p>
										Describes some aspect of the universe, a fact
										</p>
										<h2><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Common Sense</span></h2>

										<ul>

										<li>Conclusions based solely on personal experience and sensible logic
										<li>Can lead to an incorrect conclusion</li></ul>

										<h2><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Research & Observation</span></h2>

										<ul>

										<li><strong>Observation</strong> - the gathering of information by simply watching subjects <ul>

										<li>Can lead to bias as observations may be biased as the observer can change/influence  <ul>

										<li><strong>Bias</strong> - situation in which a factor unfairly increases the likelihood of a researcher reaching a particular conclusion, should be minimized as much as possible in research   <ul>

										<li><strong>Researcher Bias - </strong>the tendency to notice evidence to support one particular point/view or hypothesis, objectivity reduces bias as it relies less on the observers opinion.
										<li><strong>Participant Bias - </strong>tendency of research subjects to respond in certain ways because they know they are being watched. Will behave the way we believe the researcher wants us to behave.</li>   </ul>
										</li>   </ul>
										</li>   </ul>
										</li>   </ul>
										<ul>

										<li><strong>Naturalistic Observation</strong> -<strong> </strong>Method of observation where subjects are observed in their "natural" environment  <ul>

										<li>Subjects are not aware they are being watched (two way mirrors, hidden cameras)</li>  </ul>
										</li>  </ul>

										<h2><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Critical Thinking (Important to follow in this class)</span></h2>

										<ul>

										<li>What am I being asked to believe or accept?
										<li>What evidence is available?
										<li>Are there alternative ways of interpreting the evidence?
										<li>What additional evidence will help evaluate the alternatives?
										<li>What conclusion are most reasonable?</li></ul>

										<h2><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Case Studies</span></h2>

										<ul>

										<li>In depth study of one individual with the hopes of determining universal principles of behavior <ul>

										<li><strong>VERY OPEN TO BIAS</strong>
										<li>Difficulty of applying data from one person to everyone (data unrepresentative of everyone)
										<li><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Why do we need case studies?</span> <ul>

										<li>Sometimes a case study is all that is ethically possible (i.e. survivors of concentration camps, child abuse, madden tournament shooting, etc. <strong>We can't recreate these</strong>)
										<li><strong>Limitations of case studies</strong> <ul>

										<li>They are useless in providing evidence to test behavioral theories or treatments
										<li>Most case studies rely on the observations of a single investigator</li> </ul>
										</li> </ul>
										</li> </ul>
										</li> </ul>

										<h2><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Correlation</span></h2>

										<ul>

										<li><strong>Correlation != Causation (duh doy, common sense)</strong>
										<li>Know the extent to which two variables are related <ul>

										<li><strong>Correlational Study </strong>- research study designed to determine the degree to which two variables are related to another  <ul>

										<li>Do not determine why the two variables are related- just that they are related
										<li><strong>DO NOT IMPLY A CAUSE AND EFFECT RELATIONSHIP</strong>
										<li>Are helpful to making predictions
										<li><strong>Scatterplots - </strong>How we figure out correlation, graph determines type of correlation</li></ul>
										</li></ul>
										</li></ul>
										<ul>

										<li><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Positive correlation</span> - (rises together and falls together, i.e. x goes up, y goes up; x goes down, y goes down)
										<li><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Negative correlation</span> - (inverse, i.e. x goes up, y goes down; y goes up, x goes down)
										<li><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Zero correlation</span> - (no relationship between variables, "scattered")</li> </ul>

										<h2><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Survey Method</span></h2>

										<ul>

										<li>Research method that relies and self-reports: uses surveys, questionnaires, interviews. <ul>

										<li>Usually very efficient and inexpensive
										<li><strong>Population </strong>- the large group from which your sample comes from
										<li><strong>Random Sample </strong>- sample that represents a population, every member of the population has an <span style="text-decoration:underline;">equal chance of being included</span> in the survey
										<li><strong>Representative Sample </strong>- When a group is chosen randomly, it is representative of the population (same thing-ish as random sample)
										<li>You do not have to survey the entire population</li> </ul>
										</li> </ul>

										<h2><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Longitudinal Study</span></h2>

										<ul>

										<li>Developmental study where researchers study the same group of individuals for many years <ul>

										<li><strong>Takes a very long time</strong>
										<li>Provides a rich source of data as time passes, but can be very expensive and difficult to conduct</li> </ul>
										</li> </ul>

										<h2><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Cross-Sectional Study</span></h2>

										<ul>

										<li>Developmental study where researchers simultaneously study a number of subjects from different age groups and then compare the results. <ul>

										<li>More efficient, cheaper, easier than longitudinal studies.
										<li><strong>Group differences may be due to factors other than development.</strong></li> </ul>
										</li> </ul>

										<h2><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Experiments</span></h2>

										<ul>

										<li><strong>ONLY WAY TO DETERMINE CAUSATION (cause and effect)</strong>
										<li>The experiment is the only method that allows us to draw conclusions about cause and effect relations.
										<li>AP Test MC Example: How can we draw conclusions through cause and effect? Answer: Experimentation <ul>

										<li><strong>Theory - </strong>explanation that integrates principles and organizes and predicts behavior or events
										<li><strong>Hypothesis -</strong> testable prediction, often prompted by a theory, to enable us to accept, reject, or revise the theory
										<li><strong>OPERATIONAL DEFINITIONS - </strong>A specification of the exact procedures used to make a variable specific and measurable for research purposes  <ul>

										<li>Vital to the recreation of the experiment
										<li>You must agree with someone's definition of something when evaluating others' research
										<li><strong>Independent Variables </strong>- Causes something to happen or change.  <ul>

										<li>What causes the behavior to happen.
										<li><strong>Dependent Variables</strong> - The thing that was changed, the variable being measured.  <ul>

										<li>Behavior that the researchers are looking for.
										<li><strong>Experimental Group - </strong>The subjects who are exposed to the treatment.
										<li><strong>Control Group - </strong>The subjects who are <strong>not </strong>exposed to the independent variable.
										<li><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Blind Procedure</span></strong> - The research participants are ignorant to the expected outcome of the experiment (placebo drugs, etc.)  <ul>

										<li>Those collecting data can be influenced by their own expectations, potential issue with bias.
										<li><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Double Blind Procedure</span></strong> - both the research participants and those collecting the data are ignorant to the expected outcome of the experiment</li> </ul>
										</li> </ul>
										</li> </ul>
										</li> </ul>
										</li> </ul>
										</li> </ul>

										<h2><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Ethics</span></h2>

										<ul>

										<li><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Informed Consent </span>- </strong>Participants must be informed about the general nature of the research, <strong>any potential risk</strong> <ul>

										<li>Participants must have the right to refuse participation or withdraw at any time
										<li><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Right to be Protected from Harm and Discomfort</span></strong> <ul>

										<li>Studies involving harm or discomfort still can happen with <span style="text-decoration:underline;">informed consent</span>
										<li><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Right of Confidentiality</span></strong> - Individual data about research participants should never be released or discussed
										<li><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Right to Debriefing</span></strong> <ul>

										<li>Tell the participants a complete explanation of the research at the end of the study.
										<li><strong>Extremely important if the research involves deception</strong></li> </ul>
										</li> </ul>
										</li> </ul>
										</li> </ul>

									<h1>AP Psychology Unit 3 Notes (IN PROGRESS)</h1>
									<p>

									<hr>
									</p>
									<h2>The Human Brain</h2>

									<ul>

									<li>100 billion neurons in your body, most of them are near the brain which weighs about 3 pounds
									<li>It is responsible for all thinking, keeping you alive, etc.
									<li>It is the most complex system in the world
									<li>Even if you lose over 200,000 cells per day in your adult life, you'll still end up with over 98% of your brain cells
									<li><strong>Brain cells do regenerate</strong></li></ul>

									<h2>How Your Body Communicates</h2>


									<p>
									The body has two communication systems.
									</p><ul>

									<li>The <strong>nervous system</strong> (works quickly) <ul>

									<li>Neurons  <ul>

									<li>Electrically charged
									<li><strong>Dendrites</strong> - Receive information
									<li><strong>Axon Terminals</strong> - Carries a message down the cord (like the copper inside the rubber insulation)
									<li><strong>Myelin Sheath</strong> - insulating fatty layer that speeds transmission and protects the axon (like the rubber insulation on a lightning cable)
									<li><strong>There is a gap between neurons called <span style="text-decoration:underline;">the synaptic gap.</span></strong>
									<li><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">3 types of neurons</span></strong>   <ul>

									<li><strong>Sensory Neurons</strong>    <ul>

										<li>All of our senses
										<li>Flow up to the brain
									<li><strong>Motor Neurons</strong>    <ul>

										<li>Only flow down from the brain
										<li>Run all muscles, organs, and glands.
									<li><strong>Interneurons</strong>    <ul>

										<li>More interneurons than motor or sensory neurons
										<li>Connect sensory neurons to motor neurons
									<li>Neurons don't actually touch each other. They send information over the <strong>synapse, synaptic space, </strong>or <strong>synaptic cleft.</strong>   <ul>

									<li>The synapse acts like an electrical insulator, preventing an electric charge from racing to the next cell.
									<li>Composed of terminal buttons.
									<li><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Reuptake</span> - </strong>Neurotransmitters that are not absorbed by the connecting dendrite are reabsorbed by the sending neuron in a process called reuptake.</li>  </ul>
									</li>  </ul>
									</li>  </ul>
									</li>  </ul>
									</li>  </ul>
									</li>  </ul>
									</li>  </ul>
									</li>  </ul>

									<h2>Endorphins</h2>

									<ul>

									<li>Feel good chemical
									<li>Endorphins are not neurotransmitter molecules
									<li>Released during exercises, in injury, etc.
									<li>Classified as neuromodulatory</li></ul>

									<h2>Neural Communications</h2>

									<ul>

									<li><strong>Agonists (excite) - </strong>make neuron fire <ul>

									<li>Amplify or mimick sensation
									<li>Agonist-opiates mimic the high produced naturally
									<li><strong>Antagonists (inhibit) - </strong>stop neural firing <ul>

									<li>Blocking the absorption of our neurotransmitters
									<li>Antagonist-botulin blocks ACh</li> </ul>
									</li> </ul>
									</li> </ul>

									<p>
									<strong>Psychopharmacology </strong>- most psychoactive drugs work by blocking/enhancing synaptic transmission.
									</p>
									<p>
									<strong>Botulism</strong> <strong>- </strong>blocks release of ACh at the neuromuscular junction, causing paralysis.
									</p>
									<p>
									<strong>Curare - </strong>can stun or kill prey quickly, blocks ACh receptors
									</p><ul>

									<li><strong>Antipsychotic medications</strong> <ul>

									<li>Block dopamine receptors
									<li>Reduces schizophrenic hallucination</li> </ul>
									</li> </ul>

									<p>
									<strong>Caffeine - increases the release of excitatory…</strong>
									</p>
									<p>
									<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Neural Plasticity</span></strong> <strong>- </strong>the ability of our brains to form new connections after neurons are damaged. The brain can be changed both structurally and chemically by experience.
									</p>
									<p>
									<strong>The central nervous system consists of the brain and the spinal cord.</strong>
									</p>
									<p>
									<strong>Everything else is the peripheral nervous system.</strong>
									</p>
									<h2>Central Nervous System</h2>

									<ul>

									<li><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Contains the brain and spinal cord</span> <ul>

									<li>The Spinal Cord  <ul>

									<li>Complex cable of nerves that connects the brain to the rest of the body.</li>  </ul>
									</li>  </ul>
									</li>  </ul>

									<h2>Peripheral Nervous System		</h2>

									<ul>

									<li>All nerves that are not encased in bone
									<li>Everything but the brain and spinal cord.
									<li>Divided into two categories <strong>somatic </strong>and <strong>automatic.</strong> <ul>

									<li><strong>Somatic -</strong> controls voluntary muscle movement, uses motor (efferent) neurons.
									<li><strong>Autonomic - </strong>controls the automatic functions of the body.
									<li>Divided into two categories… the <strong>sympathetic </strong>and the <strong>parasympathetic.</strong>  <ul>

									<li><strong>Sympathetic - </strong> fight or flight responses, automatically accelerates heart rate, breathing, dilates pupils, slows down digestion, etc.
									<li><strong>Parasympathetic - </strong>automatically slows the body down after a stressful event. Heart rate and breathing slow down, pupils constrict and digestion speeds up.
									<li><strong>Reflexes</strong> <ul>

									<li>Normally, sensory (afferent) neurons take info up through the spine to the brain.
									<li>Some reactions occur when sensory neurons reach just the spinal cord
									<li><strong>It is a survival adaptation </strong></li> </ul>
									</li> </ul>
									</li> </ul>
									</li> </ul>

									<p>
									(refer to neurotransmitter chart in Google Classroom)
									</p><ul>

									<li>The <strong>endocrine system</strong> (works slowly)
